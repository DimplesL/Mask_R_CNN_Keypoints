# Mask_R_CNN_Keypoints
The original code is from "https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN" on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow.
The code reproduce the work of "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870" but does not include code for keypoints. Â 
So the work that ralice in this publication is: # modify the code to perform the detection of keypoints.

The trainig file is "main", you can biging with thid file.

This image is one of the first tests, there is no mean average presition mAP
The resunts are far from the original paper
